  'api-academy.professor-default.default_personal_intro': `I am very interested in joining the Academy, but perhaps a round of 
  introductions are in order?`,
  'api-academy.professor-default.default': `Oh, well now, an Operator! May I presume that you're here to apply for
  admission to the Academy? <br/><br/>
  I do hope so - we haven't had many Operators 
  study here at the Arcane Academy of API Arts, but each one has been 
  a model student.`,
  'api-academy.professor-default.follow_up_greeting': `Operator, hello again! Are you excited to begin your academic exploits 
  at the Academy?`,
  'api-academy.professor-default.thanks': `Well done! You've completed the admissions exercises required to join
  the Academy. Unfortunately, we are not quite prepared to have midterm 
  students enter the Academy just yet.

  'api-academy.professor-default.get_started': `All prospective students are required to master the basic tenets of 
  API usage prior to joining the Academy. In the forest to the south,
  you will find <span class="highlight">four treasure chests</span>.
  Open each one to light one of the braziers behind me.<br/><br/>
  Once all four braziers are lit, you will have proved yourself worthy 
  to enter the Arcane Academy of API Arts!`,
  'api-academy.professor-default.ack': `I wish you luck in your search. Each chest is located in a small monument
  to each of the Academy's four student houses - Lovelace, Turing, 
  von Neumann, and Hopper. Look for 
  <span class="highlight">stone structures bearing the colors</span> of 
  each house.`,
  'api-academy.professor-default.exposition': `APIs are the fundamental building blocks of programming. Most of the
  code you write will invoke code written by someone else, so mastering 
  these concepts are of utmost importance.<br/><br/>
  Also, learning to use APIs over the Internet, via HTTP, is an incredible 
  boost in power for your code. Teaching our students to unlock this power 
  is the primary purpose of the Academy.`,
  'api-academy.professor-default.personal_intro': `I am <span class="highlight">Professor Kimberly Heapsort</span>, director 
  of admissions for the Arcane Academy of API Arts. I ensure that our 
  student body is ready to learn the lessons that can be found at our

  developers from all backgrounds.`,

  'api-academy.hopper_initiation.both': `Please answer both questions!`,
  'api-academy.hopper_initiation.firstIncorrect': `The first answer is incorrect - remote APIs make use of computational
  resources and code that may reside on other computers (servers) on a
  network.`,
  'api-academy.hopper_initiation.secondIncorrect': `The second answer is incorrect - the expanded version of the acronym we 
  are looking for is "Respresentational State Transfer". Check Craig's 
  video one more time for the four-letter acronym.`,
  'api-academy.hopper_initiation.success': `You've got it! You've opened the chest of knowledge for House Hopper.`,
  'api-academy.lovelace_initiation.both': `Please answer both questions!`,
  'api-academy.lovelace_initiation.firstIncorrect': `The first answer is incorrect - the acronym for this protocol is the first
  four letters you type into the address bar when you enter the URL for a
  website in your browser.`,
  'api-academy.lovelace_initiation.secondIncorrect': `The second answer is incorrect - the name for these extra pieces of 
  information that go along with web requests is perhaps the opposite of 
  "footer".`,
  'api-academy.lovelace_initiation.success': `You've got it! You've opened the chest of knowledge for House Lovelace.`,
  'api-academy.neumann_initiation.both': `Please answer both questions!`,
  'api-academy.neumann_initiation.firstIncorrect': `The first answer is incorrect - the name for an object that you can
  access via HTTP in a RESTful API is the "R" in "URL".`,
  'api-academy.neumann_initiation.secondIncorrect': `The second answer is incorrect - Craig talks about mapping "CRUD" 
  operations (Create, Read, Update, and Delete) in his video - check the
  video out one more time to see which HTTP method is associated with 
  creation.`,
  'api-academy.neumann_initiation.success': `You've got it! You've opened the chest of knowledge for House Lovelace.`,
  'api-academy.turing_initiation.both': `Please provide an answer to both questions!`,
  'api-academy.turing_initiation.firstIncorrect': `The first answer is incorrect.`,
  'api-academy.turing_initiation.secondIncorrect': `The second answer is incorrect - In JavaScript, a function is invoked by 
  using the "." operator after a
  variable that references an object, and then is invoked with an open 
  and closed parentheses "()". Objects provide an API through these kinds
  of functions. What is the name of the API function used in the example,
  which translates the string to all uppercase characters?`,
