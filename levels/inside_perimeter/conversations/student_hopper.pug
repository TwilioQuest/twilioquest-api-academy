    Can you tell me more about House Hopper?

  response#more_info.
    What does that mean? What kinds of things do you beta test?

    If you had to say in one sentence what’s so great about API tools, what would you say?

        On behalf of House Hopper, welcome to Arcane Academy!

        The amazing thing about APIs is that they’re all about sharing resources and tools. <BR><BR>
        If code is everywhere, that means that anyone can code. And if anyone can code, that means you can unlock the power of really amazing people – oh, now you’ve got me sounding like I’m in House Turing!

        We like to test real-life tools, but we’re not just testing; we’re also applying those tools to our API studies. 
        We want to push the bounds of how we wield tools and what they let us do.<BR><BR>
        To give you a more concrete example, just the other day, I was exploring how to store data with Postman, 
        playing around with Postman parameters that let you create, share, test and document APIs. 
        It blew my mind how helpful the tool was… it also blew a hole through the roof of the greenhouse. 
        But don’t tell my Head of House I said that!

        <span class="highlight">House Hopper</span> students are known for their boldness and willingness to try new things. 
        We’re the designated beta testers. We’re not afraid of an API spell still in beta crashing or breaking on us... 
        In fact, the other houses often come to us asking us to break their spells... for R&D purposes, of course.<BR><BR>
        But seriously, at House Hopper we believe that code is everywhere, 
        and we take it upon ourselves to test out the practical implications of what that means.
