        Oh my, we haven't had a visitor to the Catacombs in quite a long while! I am Professor Hattip Restapi, but you can call me Professor Hattie. 
        I'm here to guide you through these Catacombs and help you face the challenges ahead. <br><br>
        The challenges you'll face inside these Catacombs will not only test your ability to wield the power of APIs, 
        but help you discover where your magic aligns. Is it in using code to express yourself? Solving problems with code? 
        Harnessing the theory and science underneath the code? Or using code to push the boundaries of everyday life?  

    statement#houses

        Each house specializes in unique strengths and subject matters. 
        To be honest, it's hard for me to keep up with all their activities.
        You're better off asking them directly.

       The Catacomb chambers belong to the mascots of Arcane’s four houses. 
       In each chamber, you will face new challenges to prove your abilities. 
       In turn, each mascot will grant you a portion of an Unlocking Spell that will 
       summon the key needed to enter the Sacred Scroll Room in the Catacombs’ center.<BR><BR>
       Enter this room with this key to retrieve your pledge scroll infused with the magic you have mastered.

          Before you begin, you must prove to the Knight you're ready for the trials ahead.

          you must use to get the key to the Sacred Scroll Room.

        Well done! Now you must take your pledge scroll to 
        the Head of House up on the Academy’s grounds to officially join a house. <br><br> 
        I hear that the House Gauntlet is happening soon. 
        The House Gauntlet is a riveting competition of code between each house. Now that you have proven your skill as a true Arcanian, 
        you should consider entering!

        Visit the ultimate API spellbook: the <a href="https://twilio.com/console">Twilio Console</a>. 
        From there you'll be able to find the credentials the Knight requires.
