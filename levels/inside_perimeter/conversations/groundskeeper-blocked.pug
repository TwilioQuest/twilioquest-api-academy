        Well, this is exciting! You're just in time for the House Gauntlet, which is set to start in no time! 
        Head straight on to the Main Hall, where you will find the House Fire being prepared for the House Ceremony. 
        I hope you've been thinking about which house you'd like to join!

        The House Gauntlet is a series of advanced API challenges set within each of the four house areas: 
        Lovelace Tower, Hopper Greenhouse, Neumann Labs, and Turing Fields. 
        You can get to them all from the Main Hall straight past the courtyard... 
        though some areas might be out of bounds because of the Gauntlet.
