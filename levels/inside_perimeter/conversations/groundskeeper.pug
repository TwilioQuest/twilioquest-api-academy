        Ahoy, a midterm student! The Arcane Academy of API Arts is thrilled to have you. I am the Groundskeeper at the Academy. I keep things running here. The Academy building is up and over that way, but you'll need a few things before you can begin your studies. First, you'll need a wand. I'm out of the regularly issued wands, but I think there's an extra over in the toolshed.

        Wands are used to perform spells and practice the Art of APIs. You'll need one before you can proceed. There's a toolshed over there where I think you should be able to find an old one. Look around, it might be inside a chest or box. You know how these things are, always hard to keep track of stuff. Once you find it, bring it back to me and I'll show you how to use it.

        Bring the wand back when you've found it, and I'll teach you a spell.

        Welcome back, student. Have you found the old wand in the toolshed? If so, head to the catacombs to obtain your pledge scroll.

    statement#congratulations
      if worldState.insidePerimeter.hasWand
        if !worldState.spellsEarned.includes('disappear')

          Well done! Now that you have your wand, you need to learn some spells. Here's the spell for clearing things away or making them <b>disappear</b>. You'll find you might need it as you move throughout the grounds.<br><br>

          Now that you have a wand and can use it, it's time to find a pledge scroll - you'll need to present it to the Headmaster once you get to the Academy building so you can join a house. Like every student, you'll have to head to the catacombs and endure challenges that reveal your truest nature in order to find a pledge scroll. Good luck!

          It seems you don't actually have a wand yet. Check the toolshed!

        Visit the ultimate API spellbook: the <a href="https://twilio.com/console">Twilio Console</a>. From there you'll be able to find the credentials the Statue needs.

        The toolshed is over to the right. I think I stored the wand in an old chest or box, you'll have to look around inside. Once you find it, you might need to answer a question to prove ownership: wands are tricky like that! If you need help answering the question, check out the API course --insert video or blog post link--
