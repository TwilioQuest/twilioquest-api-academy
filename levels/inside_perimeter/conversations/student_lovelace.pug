    Can you tell me more about House Lovelace?

  response#more_info.
    Does House Lovelace run activities like the other houses?

    If you had to say in one sentence what’s so great about API documentation, what would you say?

      text.
        APIs let you work across mediums to create art, generate beauty, and put good out into the world. Even a simple SMS could be a work of art. Did you know that entire stories have been written in SMS form?

       Of course! This year House Lovelace is putting on an art show entitled, “Interface Abstractions // Abstract Interfaces” 
       that explores both how API interfaces and abstractions work and how they make us feel. Good APIs are seamless and intuitive, 
       just like a work of art! 
       In fact, you’ll find that many House Lovelace graduates go on to become UX designers and developers. 
       I mean, UX is also an art, don’t you agree?

        Ah, <span class="highlight">House Lovelace</span>, house of artists... Here at Arcane Academy we work between expression and technical rigor, 
        where code is functionality but also communication, truth, and expression. 
        Have you ever sat back to observe the elegance of a beautifully executed piece of code?<BR><BR>
        There’s also an artistry to documentation too, which is our other speciality. 
        In House Lovelace we like to think of API documentation as its own artistic process.
