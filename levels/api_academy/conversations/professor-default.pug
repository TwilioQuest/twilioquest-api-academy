            Understood. I will report back when I have found all the chests.

            I am very interested in joining the Academy, but perhaps a round of 
            introductions are in order?

        Oh, well now, an Operator! May I presume that you're here to apply for
        admission to the Academy? <br/><br/>
        I do hope so - we haven't had many Operators 
        study here at the Arcane Academy of API Arts, but each one has been 
        a model student.

        Operator, hello again! Are you excited to begin your academic exploits 
        at the Academy?

        Well done! You've completed the admissions exercises required to join
        the Academy. Please proceed through the gates to enter the Arcane Academy of API Arts! Good luck with your studies, student!

          All prospective students are required to master the basic tenets of 
          API usage prior to joining the Academy. In the forest to the south,
          you will find <span class="highlight">four treasure chests</span>.
          Open each one to light one of the braziers behind me.<br/><br/>
          Once all four braziers are lit, you will have proved yourself worthy 
          to enter the Arcane Academy of API Arts!

        I wish you luck in your search. Each chest is located in a small monument
        to each of the Academy's four student houses - Lovelace, Turing, 
        von Neumann, and Hopper. Look for 
        <span class="highlight">stone structures bearing the colors</span> of 
        each house.

        APIs are the fundamental building blocks of programming. Most of the
        code you write will invoke code written by someone else, so mastering 
        these concepts are of utmost importance.<br/><br/>
        Also, learning to use APIs over the Internet, via HTTP, is an incredible 
        boost in power for your code. Teaching our students to unlock this power 
        is the primary purpose of the Academy.

        I am <span class="highlight">Professor Kimberly Heapsort</span>, director 
        of admissions for the Arcane Academy of API Arts. I ensure that our 
        student body is ready to learn the lessons that can be found at our 
        school, and that an education at the Academy is in reach for aspiring 
        developers from all backgrounds.
