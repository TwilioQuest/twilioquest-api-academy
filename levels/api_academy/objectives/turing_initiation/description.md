# Defining an API

The challenge before you is to unlock four **chests of knowledge**, one for each of the student houses at the API Academy. This chest is sponsored by **House Turing**, named for computer science pioneer [Alan Turing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Turing). To bypass the locking mechanism, you must answer a few questions related to the definition of APIs. Answer the questions on the right, and then click *HACK*.

## Learning about APIs

The challenges in the API Academy are based on [this incredible API introduction course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZvSYJDk-us) by your Fog Owl crewmate **Craig Dennis**. Click the *Show Help* button below to see an embedded portion of the video relevant to these questions.
