# RESTful APIs

The challenge before you is to unlock four **chests of knowledge**, one for each of the student houses at the API Academy. This chest is sponsored by **House von Neumann**, named for polymath and computer scientist [John von Neumann](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_von_Neumann). To bypass the locking mechanism, you must answer a few questions related to RESTful APIs. Answer the questions on the right, and then click *HACK*.

## Learning about APIs
