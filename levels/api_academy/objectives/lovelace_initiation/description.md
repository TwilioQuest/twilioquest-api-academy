# How the Web Works

The challenge before you is to unlock four **chests of knowledge**, one for each of the student houses at the API Academy. This chest is sponsored by **House Lovelace**, named for mathemetician [Ada Lovelace](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ada_Lovelace). To bypass the locking mechanism, you must answer a few questions related to how the web works. Answer the questions on the right, and then click *HACK*.

## Learning about APIs

The challenges in the API Academy are based on [this incredible API introduction course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZvSYJDk-us) by your Fog Owl crewmate **Craig Dennis**. Click the *Show Help* button below to see an embedded portion of the video relevant to these questions.
