    How about you find me after the House Gauntlet and I’ll help you out.

    Are you sure your monitor isn’t upside down? Just kidding…

    Your code must be wrong. Code only runs synchronously, one line after the other.

  response#right.
    Are there perhaps asynchronous functions?

        If you made it this far into Lovelace Tower, you must know what you’re doing. 
        Could you help me with this problem from Advanced Divination?<br><br> 
        I have this code, but my functions aren’t running in the order that I thought they would. 
        What do you think might be causing this?

    statement#busy
      text.
        Okay, Operator! Good luck on the challenges.

    statement#wrong_1
      text.
        Good one, Operator. But seriously, do you have any idea why my code might be running out of order?

    statement#wrong_2
      text.
        Now that you mention synchronous code, I do remember learning something about asynchronous code. 
        I definitely know that it’s possible to run multiple, non-blocking functions at once. 
        I promise I learned about it… I just don’t remember the specifics!<br><br>
        What do you think could be behind this asynchronous execution?

    statement#right
      text.
        Oh, that’s it! I’m making two HTTP requests and I should use the await keyword after an asynchronous 
        function to get the value back before my code keeps going.<br><br>
        I knew you’d be able to solve it for me. Thanks, Operator!
