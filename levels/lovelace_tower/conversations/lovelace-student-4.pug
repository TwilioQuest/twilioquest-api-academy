    I can’t stop right now. I’m on a roll!

    A local API is one that’s in the same area code, whereas remotes work from anywhere in The Cloud.

    There’s no difference. Local and remote mean the same thing when it comes to APIs.

    Local APIs execute directly on your machine or device, whereas remote APIs run on a server that you (likely) don’t own.

        Wow, you only have one more room in Lovelace Tower. You are just racing through the House Gauntlet!<br><br>
        Do you think you’d have time to help me with an assignment? It’s due in like an hour…<br><br>
        What is the difference between a #[span.highlight local] and #[span.highlight remote] API?

        That’s alright. You can always come back into Lovelace Tower once you’ve finished all the Gauntlet challenges. 
        I’ll be here, just trying to crack this problem… Please come back and find me!

        Hmm… something tells me it’s a bit different than that. You’re right that remote APIs will work from anywhere, 
        but that’s because they don’t need to be on your local machine. But local APIs work in another way…?<br><br>
        What could the difference be?

    statement#wrong_2
      text.
        That’s the first answer I tried, but it’s not right! I think the difference depends on where the code is actually running, right?<br><br>
        And the difference is…? If only I had paid attention during my classes…

    statement#right
      text.
        Ah, yes! The implementation of remote APIs never executes on your machine, 
        but elsewhere, which gives you computing power and scale that you might not have locally. 
        Instead, local APIs might be in your programming language or in a package that you can 
        download from the internet, but they run locally on your machine or device.<br><br>
        All I needed was to stand next to you and it would all come back to me! Thanks, Operator!
