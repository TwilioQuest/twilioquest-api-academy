  response#wrong_1.
    Have you tried...

mixin wrong_2
  response#wrong_2.
    What about...

mixin right
  response#right.
    The answer should be...

conversation(display_name="House Lovelace Student")
  case lastResponse
    
    when "busy"
      statement#busy
    
    when "wrong_1"
      statement#wrong_1 
      responses 
        +busy 
        +wrong_2 
        +right 

    when "wrong_2"
      statement#wrong_2 
      responses 
        +busy 
        +wrong_1 
        +right

    when "right"
      statement#right

        Wow, you only have one more room in Lovelace Tower. You are just racing through the House Gauntlet!<br><br>
        Do you think you’d have time to help me with an assignment? It’s due in like an hour…<br><br>
        What is...

        That’s alright. You can always come back into Lovelace Tower once you’ve finished all the Gauntlet challenges. 
        I’ll be here, just trying to crack this problem… Please come back and find me!

        It couldn’t be that, I don’t think…

    statement#wrong_2

        That’s the first answer I tried, but it’s not quite right.

        You got it! See, I knew an Operator competing in the House Gauntlet would be able to solve these problems!

// Flush world state changes, if any
