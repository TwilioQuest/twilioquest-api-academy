    I’d love to help but I’m only halfway through my own objectives!

    PUT isn’t actually an HTTP verb.

    PUT allows you to delete resources.

    PUT is a request to modify a resource state.

        Thank goodness you made it through the second door. 
        This API problem set is due in an hour, and I’m barely through the first question.<br><br>
        “What is the definition of #[span.highlight PUT] in HTTP Protocol Semantics?” That’s the question, 
        but now I’m not sure I even understand what it’s asking!

        Ah, that’s too bad. I wanted to be able to say that a real, 
        live Operator helped me with my homework problems. Maybe next time!

        Hmm, I could have sworn my professor said PUT is an HTTP... like GET and POST – those are also HTTP verbs, right?<br><br>
        Hmm… what could PUT be used for?


    statement#wrong_2
      text.
        I’m pretty sure DELETE is its own HTTP verb that allows you to… delete resources. Haha, right?<br><br>
        And PUT instead let’s you…? Hmm…


    statement#right
      text.
        Yes, that’s right, I remember now! When you make a PUT request, the client takes the representation then modifies the resource. 
        PUT requests update a resource by replacing the entire entity, 
        whereas PATCH only updates a portion of the resource without changing other fields.<br><br>
        Thank you so much for helping!
