    I wish I could help, but I’ve got to concentrate on the next objective.

    There is no difference between resources and representations.

mixin wrong_2
  response#wrong_2.
    Resources are unnamed things on the web, and representations are groups of resources.

    A resource is anything with a URL, and a representation is an explanation of the state of a resource.

        I know you’re really busy, but would you mind helping me figure out this homework problem?<br><br>
        What is the difference between #[span.highlight resources] and #[span.highlight representations] when it comes to APIs?

        I understand. Good luck, Operator!

        No, I don’t think that’s it. They’re related, but they are definitely different.<br><br>

        Hmm… I tried that one already, but it’s not quite right. 
        Resources need to be named, I know that much! And representations are related to resources, 
        but in a different way… Try again?<br><br>
        How are the two different?

    statement#right
      text.
        Yes, that’s right! Anything can be a resource as long as it has a Uniform Resource Locator (URL), 
        and a representation can be any machine-readable document, 
        like JSON, containing any information about a resource. I knew you’d have the answer!

// Flush world state changes, if any
- setState(STATE_KEY, worldState);
