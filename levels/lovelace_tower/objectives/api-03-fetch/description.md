The House Gauntlet welcomes you to the third challenge of Lovelace Tower! In this challenge, you must test the powers of `await` by `fetch`ing a magical phrase. You may find this process helpful, Gauntleter, when generating the Divination Spell that will be granted to you in Lovelace Tower upon completion of its challenges.

Before we get started, let's take a look at an example of fetching data from an API:

```js
const response = await fetch("some_url");
console.log(response);
```

The example above uses `fetch` to request data from "some_url", uses `await` to "pause" the code until it's finished fetching, and then prints the response to the console.

Create a function called "getMagicalPhrase" that uses `fetch` and `await` to request a magical phrase from the "magic" endpoint, then copy and paste it into the input. You may have to `console.log` in order to see it!

Once you're all done, click the _HACK_ button!
