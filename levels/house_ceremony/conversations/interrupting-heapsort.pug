    Can I help in some way?

    I would be happy to fill in. 
    What do I have to do for the House Gauntlet? Where do I start?

    Are you going to look for the missing student?

        Oh my, colleagues and students! A most terrible thing has happened. 
        The Gauntleter who was supposed to represent House [INSERT CHOSEN HOUSE] 
        in the House Gauntlet has gone missing!

        Well, you’ve just joined the Academy, right? 
        And you’ve just joined House [INSERT CHOSEN HOUSE]? 
        Now that you mention it… I think you could help. 
        Would you be able to take the place of House [INSERT CHOSEN HOUSE]’s Gauntleter?

        The House Gauntlet will take place in each of the four houses. 
        You will begin in House Lovelace, where you will earn a spell that will open the next House, 
        and so on. Each house can be accessed from the four corridors leading off the Main Hall.<br><br>
        To start the Gauntlet, head to the Lovelace corridor decked in Lovelace blue up on the second floor of the Main Hall.

        Of course! We’ll begin the search immediately. I’m sure it’s nothing...<br><br>
        *swallows nervously*<br><br>
        She’s bound to turn up any minute now. It’s definitely nothing to be concerned about, 
        especially if you are able to undertake the challenges of the House Gauntlet. 
        I’m sure it’s nothing... too... malicious… Yes, no, certainly not.
