# Video: Remote APIs

As you prepare to prove yourself to the House Lovelace mascot, you find an inscription in the stone beside the mascot statue. It appears to be some kind of magical graffiti, study notes inscribed by the previous students who’ve faced these challenges before you.

<blockquote>
<hr/>
<p>
THE MOST CHALLENGING SET OF QUESTIONS YET! AS THIS IS HOUSE LOVELACE I KNOW I MUST UTILIZE THE DOCUMENTATION ON <a href="HTTPS://WWW.TWILIO.COM/DOCS/SMS/API/MESSAGE-RESOURCE#CREATE-A-MESSAGE-RESOURCE" target="blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">CREATING A MESSAGE RESOURCE</a>.
</p>
<p>
IT APPEARS I CAN CHOOSE THE PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE... THERE’S EVEN PRE-WRITTEN CODE IN EACH LANGUAGE I CAN COPY TO MY TERMINAL...
</p>
<p>
NOW, WHAT DO I NEED TO UPDATE TO GET THIS MESSAGE SENT?
</p>
